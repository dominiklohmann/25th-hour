# ðŸŒ„ 25th Hour

Dynamic desktop wallpaper for macOS 10.14 Mojave based on [Louis Coyles
Lakeside Sunrise][lakeside-sunrise] and its [SVG animation 25th
hour][25th-hour].

Created by filming a full cycle (60 seconds exactly) of the SVG animation and
using `ffmpeg -i 25th-hour.mov -vf fps=16/60 assets/%03d.png` to convert into
16 equidistant frames.

The frames were then converted into a HEIC file using
[wallpapper][gh-wallpapper].
